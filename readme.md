## What is this website?
This website is a half-serious, half-joke *~~waifu propaganda~~* website for our holy goddess, Mai Sakurajima. It features a home page containing some information about Mai and a music player. Besides this, there's also the Gallery Page to view pictures of Mai. And soon, there'll also be a quotes page to view random quotes from Mai.  
The Website also has a language system, so everyone can [contribute](https://maisakurajima.netlify.app/contribute) translations.
